                    <p>Welcome to my personal page! Thank you for coming. I hope you will stay a while. 
                        I am Nurul Haffizah, a 20-year-old girl, an information management student 
                        at UiTM Rembau, a nature photography lover and also a person who likes to collect 
                        and read books. This is my assignment for the subject IMD311,
                        Prepared for Madam Seri Intan Idayu Shahrul Asari.<br>

                        Seeing the beauty of nature is one of my favourite hobbies. It is because nature can 
                        make me happier and more relaxed. Other than that, is reading.
                        My love for reading started at a very young age, 
                        but then it all disappeared when I entered university, but now, 
                        I still collect books even if I do not read them.
                        Among my favorite authors are Sara Aisha, Nurul Ain Syuhada, Aisyahros, Elveroseth, 
                        Syuariani, Akyel Rahim, Ahmad Patria and many others.<br>
                        <br>
                        When I am not busy with books, I am either listening to songs, playing crosswords,
                        playing games or doing random things with my family and friends.</p>
