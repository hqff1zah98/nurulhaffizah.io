                    <h1 class="headings">Not Here to Stay</h1>
                    <p>Sarah Amani is a Worldsmith. At eighteen, she accidentally conjured a mythical world 
                        she called Lagenda from her mind with the help of a past lover, Malik. 
                        Five years had passed and she was on a straight path to healing and moving on. 
                        She made sure nobody could enter Lagenda again and only allowed people 
                        to come in as wanderers by giving them petals as tickets. 
                        It was her way of ensuring that Lagenda remained hers without destroying it. 
                        Just when she thought she could leave her past, she was invited back into the world 
                        with a note saying "You know what to do. -M". 
                        She had to go back to Lagenda to make sure the person who sent her 
                        the note could not take the world from her. 
                        What Amani found is that Lagenda was not as abandoned as she thought it was. 
                        Determined to save her world from being exploited and smeared more 
                        than how it already is, she sets to burn every door and relic holding the world 
                        together. If she cannot keep Lagenda, nobody should. 
                        But it seemed that the person who sent her the note had other plans. 
                        Together with her trusty dagger, Misya, her sister, a stubborn historian 
                        called Najmi and all the misfits she never dreamed of collaborating with,
                        she would find herself propelling straight to her dark past and beloved world.</p>

                    <h1 class="headings">The Mountain is You</h1>
                    <p>This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, 
                        and how to stop doing itâ€”for good. Coexisting but conflicting needs 
                        create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, 
                        often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight 
                        from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better 
                        understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, 
                        and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, 
                        we can step out of our own way and into our potential. 
                        For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor 
                        for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome.
                        To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep 
                        internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, 
                        and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, 
                        it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.</p>

                    <h1 class="headings">We Hunt The Flame</h1>
                    <p>Zafira is the Hunter, disguising herself as a man when she braves the cursed forest 
                        of the Arz to feed her people. Nasir is the Prince of Death, assassinating those 
                        foolish enough to defy his autocratic father, the sultan. If Zafira was exposed as 
                        a girl, all of her achievements would be rejected; if Nasir displayed his compassion,
                        his father would punish him in the most brutal of ways. Both Zafira and Nasir are 
                        legends in the kingdom of Arawiya--but neither wants to be. War is brewing, and the 
                        Arz sweeps closer with each passing day, engulfing the land in shadow. 
                        When Zafira embarks on a quest to uncover a lost artifact that can restore magic 
                        to her suffering world and stop the Arz, Nasir is sent by the sultan on a similar 
                        mission: retrieve the artifact and kill the Hunter. But an ancient evil stirs as 
                        their journey unfolds--and the prize they seek may pose a threat greater than either 
                        can imagine.</p>
